I will notify Dr. Delso tommorrow and I will be recommending some other on-line project for us to pursue.  I am less than pleased with the handling of this site and you have not kept your word to me.  As such, I am recommending to my people to NOT support this site.   \\n\\nJeff V. Merkey\\n\\nI have been out most of the day and have reviewed what\\'s gone on here on this site since I have been out with my wife and son.  I have asked Marty (mmartin) to cease in posting me to this section or this article, and to be honest, while it strokes my ego a great deal, I cannot support a sewer site like this one based upon what I have seen go on here.  I am a member of the Nation but I am not going to post private information to this site, or allow  this \"\"lynch mob\"\" mentality to go on here, nor do I have to image my tribal card and post it to the internet to satisfy some anonymous poster from Australia.  I have had several conversations over the past week with user:Jimbo_Wales about the activities that go on with this site, and at this point, I am going to recommend to Dr. Delso at the Cherokee Nation education department at the Nation that I cease my support of this site.  I had intended and begun a full tutorial on our language and had already begun it with the translations and cultural information section.  In short, user:Jimbo_Wales WORD IS NO GOOD and he is a LIAR.  He gave me his assurances that these types of attacks would not go on here, but what has happened in the SCOX message board has basically moved to this site and have continued their stalking and harrassment and it has continued unabated.  At this point, this in not constructive for my people or my culture to support an organization that simply allows \"\"thundering herd\"\" libel and personal attacks on individuals, reverts and defacement of information, and the so-called \"\"admins\"\" of this site are just as immature, if not more so, than the persons engaging in libel.  As such, I am reverting and removing and marking for deletion all content I have contributed to date.  I have been very unimpressed with the people on this site running it.  It appears to be a group of immature high schoolers and college graduates who cannot tell the difference between adults and children.

I have no doubt they are true, but the tales, though entertaining at first quickly grow weary if one is not a teenager or an Oprah addict. They are irrelevant, except to prove that Ira did not smell. Women were attracted to him. He did not smell at all when I met him in 1974.  Ira\\'s understanding of \"\"free energy\"\" and his reference to Tom Bearden are not to my liking because the physics is wrong. However, his connections to the Yugoslavs in 1977 when Holly was murdered, the Shah of Iran\\'s family and many of his political activities made him many powerful enemies with the motive and opportunity to frame him and to weaken the movement he was spearheading. Ira\\'s account of a UFO close encounter rings true. Note Ira\\'s mention of Michael Murphy, Kit Green and Jacques Vallee.\\n\\nFor \"\"free energy\"\" read \"\"zero point vacuum energy\"\". Ira is not a physicist and he was fooled by disinformation agent Colonel Tom Bearden whose claims are worthless. At that time I had not yet figured out the physics of what Ira was after. He was my book agent and I was one of his network of \"\"300\"\" that corresponds also to http://stardrive.org/cartoon/spectra.html\\n\\nI would not solve the paranormal physics Russian psychotronics weapons problem of DCI Richard Helms until the mid 1990\\'s, i.e. the necessity of signal nonlocality from \"\"two way relation\"\" between pilot BIT wave and IT particle \"\"hidden variable\"\" and the consequent replacement of micro-quantum theory with the macro-quantum theory of \"\"More is different\"\" emergent systems.\\n\\nI would not solve the UFO problem until 2001 when the meaning of \"\"dark energy\"\" for \"\"metric engineering warp and wormhole\"\" dawned on me as through the glass darkly.

              " ' Anarchism versus Religion \\n\\nAnarchism what does it mean for this anarchist hobbyist?\\n\\nAnarchism started the First World War over the anarchist assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria.  A anarchist decided to interrupt a world power practicing imperialism and assassinated the Archduke as he drove by the anarchist in the tiny nation of Serbia.  What the anarchist did not know is that there were a multitude of secret treaties among no less that fourteen nations including attitude from the Ottoman Empire and within weeks the world was at war as Serbia was invaded.\\n\\nThe result of the war that started in the tiny nation of Serbia is millions of deaths, chemical warfare, proof of machine gun and artillery fire, introduction of aviation into warfare, the Russian communist revolution, and a new world order that led to World War Two, since the Germans believed it was their leaders who failed them causing them to lose the war.\\n\\nWorld War Two led to millions of deaths and a larger battlefield across the world including China and the Pacific Ocean (Japan was part of World War One, but the results were insignificant compared to the bloody battlefields of Europe).  The results of World War Two led to nuclear weapons, a space race, spy satellites, nuclear ships, nuclear bombers, nuclear missiles, communism across the world from communist Russia, United States being called imperialist due to being a world wide undefeated military power who is unafraid to invade anyone except the nations with the largest and best militaries (Iraq had a lager but sad capability military).  World War Two also led to the Cold War, Korean War, Vietnam War, and Desert Storm One that was the result of the former allies of World War Two dividing among themselves into two parties and fighting low intensity and hot wars across the world until the year 1991 including, for many families, three or more generations of military service from the United States.\\n\\nSerbia as a result of the wars across the world of the 20th century has been subjected to the Muslims, Russians, United States, Germans, and civil war within itself and still has United States intervention this 21st century.  Under President Clinton Serbia was made smaller requiring a split of Kosovo and Serbia after a long bombing campaign that exhausted the stockpile of conventional United States missiles during the 1990s.\\n\\nSerbia got its anarchy and is a backwards nation that has been under subjugation and gunfire since the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.\\n\\nEmbrace anarchy and declare Heaven non-religion in a discussion section where Heaven is something of the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim faith where the other faiths are atheistic in nature and worship man by a code of conduct, then you should embrace anarchy and go live off the lands in a mountain.  You have little knowledge of mythology and I bet you have no idea what you are doing concerning religion other than your personal attitude.',\n",
              " '\"\\n\\nWell, dear Ahasuerus: It is actually difficult to edit any page in Wikipedia without Muslims jumping at you and trying to censor you with all sorts of excuses. You must understand that the freedom of speech for Muslims is an alien concept. In Islamic countries if you say something against Islam they kill you. Where they can\\'t kill you, they censor you. Wikipedia seems to be dominated by Muslims. This of course is not true in all the pages where Muslims have no interest, but when the interest of Islam comes in, they can be quite bullish in making their word prevail. But that is another story. This article started with some explanation like this:\\n\\nIn recent years especially after the 9/11 some observers, including Muslim dissidents have stated that Islam presents a threat bigger than Nazism not to just the Western world but to all non-Islamic countries. They have labeled those who defend Islam and try to be politically correct about it, the today’s useful idiots. \\n\\n[Ali Sina] states: “They are idiots because they speak without knowledge of Islam and its threat to mankind and they are useful to the Islamists with whose help they can penetrate the non-Muslim countries and destroy them from within.”  The same author writes: “More abhorrent than war is making peace with evil. In the words of the 18th Century British parliamentarian Edmund Burke, \"\"All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.\"\" Those who advocate peace with Islam are idiots of this century. If we do not stand against Islam it will grow and then billions will die. Trying to appease Muslims is foolish. It is informed by ignorance of Islam. Most cancers are treatable, if detected in time. But if ignored, they will grow to a stage that will kill you. Today we have the choice. We can either fight Islam and extirpate it before it threatens our existence or wait and face the apocalypses.” \\n\\nMuslims obviously don\\'t like Ali Sina. For some reason anything you post here from him they will delete at once. So the above passage that explained the concept was deleted. The administrator SlimVirgin despite claiming impartiality, has yet to show that in actions. I could be wrong but for reasons that I explained to her, I have still to be convinced of that claim. I found out that she is Iranian, like Ali Sina, but of course most Iranians are still Muslims. She even once tried to discredit Ali Sina saying that he is Islamophobic. Obviously she sees genuine criticism of Islam unwarranted and interprets that as Islamophobia. My judgement about her is just based on my first impression and I could be wrong. I have explained to her my concern about her impartiality already and I hope she will eventually show I had misjudged her. \\n\\nIn Wikipedia there is a lot of Islamic propaganda which are not true at all, but generally critical views about Islam do not survive. Why? If Wikipedia is impartial shouldn’t we give equal space to both sides? Would we accept if e.g. scientologist or any other cultists try to take over the Wikipedia and disallow any criticism of their cult? What is happening is very disturbing. There are hundreds of pages in Wikipedia that are misleading because they are edited and controlled by Muslims and as soon as you try to post anything showing the other side of the coin they revert it and even call your contribution “hate speech”. What about the Quran? Isn’t that book a hate speech?  \\n\\nFunny thing is that they throw at you the basic rules of Wikipedia when in reality it is they who constanly breach those rules. \\n\\nIf you try to write anything that Muslims don’t like they will delete it with invalid justifications. This is a very disturbing trend. For example the quotes of Ali Sina were removed because, as they said, he is not notable. There are 200,000 pages talking about faith freedom international. There have been death threats in Islamic sites against him, there are a few Islamic sites created just to refute him. Doesn’t all that say that he is notable at least to be quoted? Finally if he is notable enough to have a page in Wikipedia why his quotes should not be published? \\n\\nI am not familiar with the structure of Wikipedia, but I suppose there must be some committee that would check into complaints. (All I am hoping is that this committee is not already taken over by Islamists)  Is there a forum where important questions such as the direction Wikipedia is taking is discussed? \\n\\nSorry, this subject might have not belonged to this page but these are things I would like to discuss. Is there a place to do that?  My point is that if Wikipedia loses its impartiality and becomes the guardian angel of a certain cult or religion, it loses its credibility fast.  05:13 2',\n",
